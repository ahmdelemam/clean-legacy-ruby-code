# Ruby-on-rails-full-stack-test
Please carry on the following tasks:

# 1. API Task
- In this api integration challenge, you will define an input which can accept a user email and validate if the email really exists. So for example, if a user enters 'cv@internsvalley.com', it will show a success message to the user. But if he enters 'test@example.com' and given that 'example.com' does not exist as an SMTP domain, it will show an error message. https://mailboxlayer.com will show you live demonstration.

   - For the 3rd party api, you may take a look at https://mailboxlayer.com/documentation, which contains detailed api requirements. So you will use this api to accomplish the task. `As a bonus point`, you may try to handle the rate limit `(at most 5 api requests per second are allowed)` and show proper message to a user if his attempt exceeds the limit.
   
   - You are free to use any framework to develop the solution. Also you can deploy it to heroku so that we can test the solution online.
   
   - Upon completion, you can push your solution to github
   
   # 2. Ruby on Rails Task
 
 - please find the task for the Ruby Backend Position:
 
   - Given the algorithm attached `pricing_algorithm.rb`, how can we refactor the code to conform to DRY and SOLID principles.
   
   - Upon completion, you can push your solution to github
